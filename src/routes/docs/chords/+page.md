# Adding chords

When editing a show, you get a few buttons at the center bottom. One of them displays a "note" icon with the label "Chords". Click on it to enable chords mode. This will display any existing chords, and add a "+" button to the top right corner of all textboxes. Click that button to add a chord, or right-click to choose from a list.

All the chords can be dragged around in the text when chords mode is enabled. (This is currently very buggy)

## Show chords in stage display

You have to enable the chords in the stage display by selecting either a slide textbox and enabling "Chords" on the right side.
