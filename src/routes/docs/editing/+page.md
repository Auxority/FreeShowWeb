# Editing a show

To edit a show, go to the "Edit" view in the top, with a show active. Here you can select any slide, or add new on the left, change text and move/resize items in the center, and see more tools on the right side.

You can zoom in/out or enable [chords](./chords) in the bottom center. And if you hold <Key>CTRL/CMD</Key> and scroll up or down over the slides in the left panel you can show more slides at once.
