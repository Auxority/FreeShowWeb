# Events

> Add upcomming events in the calendar to quickly merge different events to a show.

If you have an existing caledar with events you can [import the events](./importing#calendar) with an .ics file.

## Creating an event

If you click "New event" or edit an existing event in the left panel you get some different options, including enabling "Repeat" if the event is repeated in a specific pattern.

You can also change the dropdown at the top from "Event" to "Schedule show" to automatically start a selected show any time in the future, if FreeShow is opened. This will notify you about it starting a minute before it plays.

## Merging events to a show

If you hold down the mouse while dragging, or hold CTRL/CMD you can select multiple events. On the right panel you can see a short summary of all the added events. Here you can also "Include slides from show", if you select a show. Lastly click the "New show" button to create a show with the events added in an easy to read format, and it also has "go to next slide" timers.
