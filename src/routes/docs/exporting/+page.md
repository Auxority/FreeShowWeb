# Exporting

Access from the application menu: **File** -> **Export**. Or press _CTRL/CMD + E_.

These are the currently cupported export options:

### TXT

Will create a text file from all the selected shows.

### PDF

Will create a PDF for each of the selected shows. Here you can tweak a lot of settings, like to only export lyrics, only slides, or both.

### Project

This will export a .project file, containing the current project list and all of the shows contents. This can be imported by FreeShow on another device. _Media files have to be transported manually right now._
