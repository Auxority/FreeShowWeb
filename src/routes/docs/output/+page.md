# The output

> The output is one or more windows that displays the main content to the audience.

## Enabling the output

To activate the output window, you have to press the button with an arrow in the top right corner. The button is red when the output window is active. Right under the button you have an output preview that shows the same as in the window, there is also an audio visualizer to the right of the preview. If you get a popup stating that the output can't display you have to change the [output settings](#settings) to the correct screen.

## Settings

You can find the output settings by clicking the gear icon in the top right, and choosing "Outputs" from the left menu. Here you can change a lot of things, you can add [multiple outputs](./outputs), change the default background color, the resolution, even set a template to override the current output style.

But if you want to change the position of the current output window, try this:

-   Click "Choose screen", and click the screen if it shows up here.
-   If you can't find it here, then change the X/Y values (with the mouse wheel to change faster) until you can see the window over the screen.
-   Remember to click the "enable output window" button in the top right, so it is red.

## Layers

The output has different layers, which determines what gets priority over what. Backgrounds are shown under all the other layers, then slides and overlays. After that comes audio and slide timers, but they are not visual. Each layer can be toggled on or off independently of each other.

You can see all the layers in the "Show" view, on the right side right under the "Clear all" button. If a layer is active you can click on it to see more info, like media controls for the background. When a layer is selected, the button will have a red color, meaning when you click it, that layer will be cleared.

Press the big "Clear all" button to clear all layers.

## Controls

Right over the layers, and under the output preview area you will find some output controls.

Click the first or last buttons to change the current project element (same as arrow down/up on the keyboard). The next buttons are for changing the current slide in the currently outputted show (same as arrow left/right on the keyboard, or the spacebar). And in the center there is a button to lock the output, meaning it's not possible to change the output until unlocked. And lastly there is a play/reset button, that will play the selected show or replay the current outputted slide with any changes.
