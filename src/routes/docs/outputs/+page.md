# Multiple outputs

> In the [output settings](./output#settings) you can add as many outputs as you would like.

:::admonition type=tip
You can enable or disable each individual output. It's recommended to have different colors for different outputs.

## How to use

When you have more than one output active you will get some buttons over the output preview on the right side, where you can click on them to toggle the active output windows, or hold <Key>CTRL/CMD</Key> to select just one. And right click any of them to show or hide individual windows.

When starting a show, or clearing layers it will only change the selected output windows.

### Specific outputs

When right clicking a slide or a textbox, you can hover over the option "Specific outputs" where you can set it to only show up in one or a few specific outputs.
