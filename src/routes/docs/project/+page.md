# Project

A project is a playlist with all the songs, videos, presentations and other elements for your meeting. To add a new element you can drag it from the [drawer](./drawer), or drag a media file from the computer directly. Drag elements inside the project to rearrange them.

To navigate between elements you can click them or press the arrow down/up buttons on the keyboard.

## Sections

Click the button in the bottom of the project area to add a new section. Here you can add titles for reference in your playlist, and add lots of notes.
