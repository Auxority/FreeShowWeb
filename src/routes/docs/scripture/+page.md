# Scripture

Choose from over 200 bible versions from [API.Bible](https://scripture.api.bible/), or import you own local file from Zefania or beblia.com in XLM format, or OpenSong format. In the center you can find all of the books, chapters and verses.

## Search

Start searching to quickly select any verse in the bible, it will auto complete the book name. Can be like this: **"John 1:1-4"**, or like this: **"Genesis 1:1-2+5"**, then press _enter_ to show in output.

You can also select verses manually by holding CTRL/CMD while clicking on them. Double clicking any verse will show it in the output.

## Create a show

On the right side you can see a preview of what the output will look like. Here you can tweak some settings, and change the [template](./drawer#templates). Click "New show" to create a normal show from the scripture.

The "Max verses per slide" means the maximum amount of bible verses per slide before creating a new one. Say this is set to 3, and you select ten verses. Then you will get four slides, three with three verses and the last with one verse.
