# Change the output styling

> Use styles to override the output with different looks.

## Background

Change the background color, or set a background image that will always show when you clear all.
You can also change the resolution if you want. In most cases you just want to leave it at the default. This does not affect the resolution of the content itself, just the placement and the size.

## Resolution

Change the output resolution. (Note that this does not affect the [output screen size](./output#settings)).
This also goes hand in hand with the "Media Fit" option, in many cases this should be set to "Cover" when changing the resolution. You also have to create a new template that matches the new resolution.

## Lines

If you set this to 2 all the textboxes will show max 2 lines in the output at the time. This is useful if you show e.g. 4-5 lines in the main output, and want a second live stream output to only show 2 outputs at a time. Set to 0 to show all lines.

## Toggle layers

Click on the different active layers to toggle them, useful again if you don't want to show the background in a livestream.

## Template

You can set a template to override the output style to get different styles in outputs with the same input, useful for [lower thirds](./outputs#how-to-create-lower-third-display-for-a-live-stream). The template text color will be used, unless the slide item text has multiple colors, in that case the original colors will be used!

## Metadata

Change the looks of show metadata or a show message, and choose when to display the metadata.
