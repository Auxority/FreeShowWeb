# Change the output styling

> Use styles to override the output with different looks.

## Background

Change the background color, or set a background image that will always show when you clear all.
You can also change the resolution if you want. In most cases you just want to leave it at the default. This does not affect the resolution of the content itself, just the placement and the size.

## Lines

If you set this to 2 all the textboxes will show max 2 lines in the output at the time. This is useful if you show e.g. 4-5 lines in the main output, and want a second live stream output to only show 2 outputs at a time. Set to 0 to show all lines.

## Toggle layers

Click on the different active layers to toggle them, useful again if you don't want to show the background in a livestream.

## Metadata

Change the looks of show metadata og a show message, and choose when to display the metadata.
