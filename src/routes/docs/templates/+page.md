> Create a template to quickly change the style of any show.

Template works very similar to [overlays](./overlays). Clicking on a template when a show is opened will override the style in the show with the style from the template. The show will remember the template, so it will always update if you edit the template. When you edit the show items (not the text) it will no longer update from the template.

You can also drag a template to a specific slide to apply the style to just that slide.
