> Create and play a countdown timer to a set time or a comming event.

When creating or editing a timer you have some different options. You can choose "From start to end" which is e.g. from 5 minutes to 0. You can choose towards a time to count to a specific clock time. This will reset when the time passes 00:00 so it can't go more than 24 hours. Lastly you can choose "Time until event" which will count towars the start time of a future event from the "Calendar" page.

## Overflow

Enable "Overflow when reached end" to allow the time to go past the end time.
