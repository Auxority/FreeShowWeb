# Show tools

The show tools are located on the right side when you are in "Show" view, with a show selected. Here is a list describing all the tools:

### Groups

Here you will find all of the current groups in the current show, and a list of all your global groups. Click or drag them to the center to add them to the current layout.

### Media

See all of the media layers in all of the layouts. This includes all of the backgrounds, audio, microphones and MIDI actions.

### Metadata

Set metadata like title, artist and CCLI data about the current song. This can be enabled to display under the output settings. Here you can also display a message to the output that shows all the time when the show is playing. You can also get the metadata from JPEG images set as background. Also at the bottom you can change the looks and change the slides they are showing at. This can also be set globally on the output with [Styles](./styles).

### Notes

Add some notes to the show.
