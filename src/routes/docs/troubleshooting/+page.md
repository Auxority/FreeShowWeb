### The output is lagging

To make it clear, the preview in the top right corner is not the same as the actual output, it is a mirror of your main output. The frame rate of this window might be lowered to ensure a smooth presentation in the main output. If you want to increase the frame rate, you can go to settings, then "Other", then change the "Preview frame rate", you can change it to "Full", or to "Optimized". See [output settings](./output#settings).

If the actual main output is still lagging after you have set the preview to "Optimized". You can try going to "Outputs" and turn on the KIOSK mode (maoOS only).
